## What GhostBot is

A self-hosted AI coding agent platform — one Next.js web app that combines:
- A chat interface against any LLM (cloud or self-hosted Ollama)
- Auto-learning memory across conversations (RAG via embeddings + chat summaries)
- Docker-based coding agents that clone a repo, edit code, push commits, open PRs
- Cluster orchestration for multi-role agent pipelines
- Real-time cross-device sync via SSE
- Telegram / Slack notifications, GitHub PR comment triggers
- Multi-user invitations
- A VS Code extension that mounts the live UI inside the editor

It's all one Next.js app + a separate set of small ephemeral coding-agent Docker images on the host. No microservices, no message queues. SQLite + Drizzle + WAL is the only datastore.

## What's parked

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| Light mode fine-tuning | Basic light mode + toggle shipped; may need per-component polish |
| `/api/agent-jobs/diff` for non-succeeded jobs | Diff comes from GitHub compare which only exists post-push |
| VS Code Marketplace publishing | Extension v0.2 built; needs final packaging and publish |

---

## Security hardening follow-ups

The security audit (April 2026) identified 10 vulnerabilities, all patched in commits `3e17431..e2a1c10`. The following hardening items remain as follow-ups — concrete, non-blocking but worth doing before scaling beyond a single trusted admin:

| Item | Why | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Agent container resource limits (Memory / NanoCpus / PidsLimit / wall-clock timeout) | A hostile or runaway agent can still exhaust the host. Enforce limits in `src/lib/tools/docker.js` `runContainer`. | Planned |
| `docker-socket-proxy` | `/var/run/docker.sock` bind-mount grants host-root-equivalent privilege. Put it behind `tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy` with a restrictive allowlist (`containers/create`, `start`, `logs`, `remove`). | Planned |
| Split `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from `AUTH_SECRET` | Leaking `AUTH_SECRET` today compromises every encrypted secret. Separate keys let you rotate auth without re-encrypting the DB. | Planned |
| CI/CD (GitHub Actions: lint+build on PR, release on tag → GHCR) + first Vitest + Playwright suite | Currently only Vitest unit tests (9) + ad-hoc manual QA. | Planned |
| Extend rate limiting to every `/api/*` route | Currently covers chat, webhooks, clone, auth. Admin-only routes still uncovered. | Planned |

---

## Code conventions

### Naming
- Package: `ghostbot`
- Docker images: `ghostbot:coding-agent-{agent}` — e.g. `ghostbot:coding-agent-aider`
- DB file: `data/db/ghostbot.sqlite` (lives on the persistent Dokploy volume)
- Config keys: plain UPPER_SNAKE — `LLM_PROVIDER`, `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `GH_TOKEN`, etc.

### Architecture rules
- All core logic lives under `src/lib/` — never duplicate it in templates
- Server actions colocated under `src/lib/admin/`, `src/lib/chat/`, `src/lib/cluster/`, etc.
- API routes (`src/app/api/`) are for external callers and webhook receivers; everything browser-side uses server actions
- SSE endpoints under `src/app/stream/` for streaming chat tokens, sync events, cluster logs
- Docker is always reached via `src/lib/tools/docker.js` over the Unix socket — never spawn `docker` CLI
- New schema columns go into `src/lib/db/schema.js` AND `runAutoMigrations` in `src/lib/db/index.js` (using `addColumnIfMissing`). Don't generate Drizzle migrations.
- Date/time formatting always goes through `src/lib/date-format.js` — never call `toLocaleString` directly

### Security
- Secrets via `setConfigSecret` (encrypted with PBKDF2 from `AUTH_SECRET`)
- Never log secrets even on errors
- Never embed secrets in client components
- Webhook signatures verified with `crypto.timingSafeEqual` (HMAC-SHA256)
- Admin actions guarded with `requireAdmin()` (or `requireUser()` for per-user data)

### UI
- Tailwind v4 with the brand colour tokens
- Dark mode default
- Components live next to the feature they serve, not in a global `components/` folder
- Animated icons via the `src/lib/icons/` wrappers (motion + lucide)
- Standard pattern for admin pages: GET-on-mount → save → auto-test → flip to green Active card with Disconnect button (see Ollama, GitHub, Telegram, Slack admin pages for the pattern)

## Reference source

`thepopebot-main/` is a read-only reference of ThePapeBot v1.2.75. **Never modify it.** Use it to understand patterns, then implement the GhostBot equivalent in `src/`. It is gitignored.

---

## When in doubt

- Start by reading this file
- Then `README.md` for the user-facing summary
- Then `docs/OLLAMA_QWEN_SETUP.md` for the Ollama-side details
- Then the `/docs` page in the running app at `https://ghostbot.dev/docs` for the admin walkthrough
- Then the relevant `src/lib/<feature>/` folder

## Annex: Post-Audit Roadmap

> Synthesized from three independent audits (Claude, DeepSeek, Grok) conducted April 2026 against ghostbot.dev + github.com/flndrnai/ghostbot (111 commits, main branch).

### Current State Summary

GhostBot is live, deployed, and functionally complete as a self-hosted AI coding agent platform. Every feature listed in the README is implemented — chat, multi-provider LLM support, SSE sync, memory/RAG, Project Connect, Docker agents (Aider/OpenCode/Codex/Gemini CLI), cluster pipelines, GitHub PR integration, Telegram/Slack notifications, multi-user auth, admin panel, VS Code extension, encrypted settings, and one-click DB backup.

The product is done. The packaging is not.

The core problem: nobody can discover, understand, or try GhostBot without already knowing what it is. The login wall at `/` is a dead end for every visitor who isn't the admin.

### Phase 1 — Quick Wins (1–2 days each)

#### 1.1 Public Landing Page at /

**Priority: CRITICAL** — this is the single highest-impact change.

- Create a public `/` route that does NOT redirect to `/login`
- Update `src/proxy.js` to whitelist `/` as a public route
- Content to include:
  - Hero: GhostBot icon + tagline ("Self-hosted AI coding agent platform")
  - Feature grid: 6–8 cards covering chat, agents, memory, clusters, Project Connect, notifications
  - Screenshots or a 30-second screen recording (embed or autoplay GIF)
  - CTA buttons: "Self-Host Now" (links to GitHub) + "Sign In" (links to /login)
  - Tech stack badges row
  - Footer with GitHub link + MIT license badge
- Design: use existing brand — `#050509` background, `#D4AF37` gold accent, `#F5D97A` highlights, `#E5E2DA` text
- Keep it a single page, no routing complexity

#### 1.2 GitHub Repo Polish

- Set repo description: *Self-hosted AI coding agent platform — chat with any LLM, run coding agents in Docker, orchestrate multi-role pipelines*
- Set website: `https://ghostbot.dev`
- Add topics: `ai`, `coding-agent`, `self-hosted`, `llm`, `nextjs`, `docker`, `ollama`, `aider`, `rag`
- Upload social preview image (1280×640, ghost icon on dark bg with gold accent)
- Create `v1.0.0` release tag with a changelog summarizing the 111 commits
- Add screenshots to README (chat view, admin panel, agent job running, cluster pipeline, Project Connect file tree) — store in `/assets/screenshots/`

#### 1.3 docker-compose.yml for Easy Self-Hosting

- Create a production-ready compose file at repo root:
  - Services: ghostbot app + ollama (optional)
  - Volumes: ghostbot-data (SQLite + memory), ollama-models
  - Bind mount: `/var/run/docker.sock` for agent containers
  - Env: `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_TRUST_HOST`, `NODE_ENV`, `DATABASE_PATH`
- Include an `.env.example` with all required/optional vars documented
- Add a `docker-compose.dev.yml` variant for local development
- Update README quick-start to lead with `docker compose up -d` as the primary path
- Add one-click deploy buttons where possible (Railway, Render)

#### 1.4 VS Code Extension → Marketplace

- Create a VS Code Marketplace publisher account under `flndrnai`
- Add a proper `package.json` with publisher field, icon, categories, keywords
- Build `.vsix` and publish v0.1.0
- Add a GitHub Actions workflow: on tag push `vscode-ext/v*` → auto-build and publish
- Link from README and landing page

### Phase 2 — Onboarding & Documentation (1–2 weeks)

#### 2.1 First-Run Setup Wizard

After admin account creation on first visit, redirect to `/setup` (new route):
1. Step 1: Choose LLM provider → Ollama URL / Anthropic key / OpenAI key / Google key
2. Step 2: (Optional) Docker check → verify `/var/run/docker.sock` is mounted, show available agent images
3. Step 3: (Optional) GitHub PAT → paste token, validate scopes
4. Step 4: (Optional) Notifications → Telegram bot token + webhook URL / Slack app token
5. Step 5: Done → redirect to first chat with a welcome message

Store wizard completion state in settings table so it only shows once.

#### 2.2 Expand /docs In-App Guide

Build out with: Getting started, Chat features, Project Connect, Coding agents, Cluster pipelines, Admin reference, Troubleshooting.

#### 2.3 Project Connect Docker Mount Documentation

Add a dedicated section in `/docs` and in the admin UI for Dokploy/Docker production bind-mount instructions.

### Phase 3 — Robustness & DevOps (2–4 weeks)

#### 3.1 CI/CD Pipeline

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: lint + build check on every PR/push to main
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: on tag push → build Docker image, push to GHCR, create GitHub Release
- Basic test suite: Vitest for unit, Playwright for E2E

#### 3.2 Agent Container Resource Limits

Enforce `Memory: 2GB`, `NanoCpus: 1 CPU`, `PidsLimit: 256` when launching agent containers. Make configurable per agent type. Add timeout (default 15 min).

#### 3.3 Monitoring & Logging Improvements

Live agent job log streaming, token usage dashboard, active container list, memory store stats.

#### 3.4 PWA Support

`manifest.json`, minimal service worker for offline shell caching, install prompt banner on mobile.

#### 3.5 Rate Limiting

In-memory token bucket on `/api/*` routes. Especially: LLM chat, agent job launches, auth endpoints.

### Phase 4 — Feature Depth (ongoing)

#### 4.1 Reference Features

| Feature | Differentiation | Effort | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Voice-to-text input (Whisper/AssemblyAI) | High | Medium | Next |
| In-browser terminal (xterm.js) | High | Medium | Next |
| Monaco editor + diff viewer | Medium | High | Later |
| More agents (Claude Code, etc.) | Medium | Low each | Ongoing |
| File-watch triggers | Medium | Medium | Later |
| Full cron system | Low | Low | Later |

#### 4.2 Horizontal Scaling Path

Document the ceiling: SQLite + in-process SSE = single server. If demand grows, swap to Redis pub/sub + Turso/PostgreSQL.

#### 4.3 Hosted Demo Instance

`demo.ghostbot.dev` with read-only Ollama backend, pre-seeded data, auto-reset every 24h, no agent launching.

### Rules for Claude Code Sessions on This Annex

- Work phase by phase, do not skip ahead
- Each phase item gets its own commit with a descriptive message
- Test locally before committing (especially route protection changes — Next.js `proxy.js`, the successor to the old `middleware.js` convention)
- Landing page must match existing brand tokens exactly — no new colors, no new fonts
- Docker-compose must be tested with a clean `docker compose up -d` on a fresh machine
- VS Code extension publish requires marketplace credentials — pause and ask
- Agent resource limits: test with a deliberately slow/infinite agent before shipping
- Never break the existing login → chat → agent flow while adding new routes
- Never display email addresses anywhere in the UI, logs, or public-facing pages — mask or omit entirely
- Never display IP addresses anywhere in the UI, logs, or public-facing pages — mask or omit entirely

## Annex: Claude Code Audit — Full Assessment

> Independent assessment conducted by Claude Code against the live deployment at ghostbot.dev and the source repo (111 commits, main branch).

### What's Live & Working

The site at ghostbot.dev is deployed and serving a real Next.js app. The core deployment pipeline (Dokploy + Dockerfile + SQLite persistence) is functional. Based on the 111 commits and the detailed project structure, the following is built and working:

- **Core chat platform** — multi-provider LLM chat (Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google), SSE-based real-time sync across devices, markdown rendering with code blocks + copy buttons, image paste + vision support for multimodal models.
- **Auth & multi-user** — NextAuth v5 with credentials/JWT, admin account setup on first visit, invitation system with one-time tokens, role isolation (admin/user).
- **Database layer** — 15-table SQLite schema via Drizzle ORM with WAL mode and runtime auto-migrations. Encrypted settings store (AES-256-GCM). Solid engineering.
- **Memory/RAG system** — auto-summarization of chats, embedding via nomic-embed-text, semantic retrieval of past context into new conversations.
- **Project Connect** — attach a project folder to a chat, browse file tree, inject CLAUDE.md into system prompts, launch agents directly on the project.
- **Docker coding agents** — Aider, OpenCode, Codex, Gemini CLI each in their own container image. Launch from chat, agent clones repo, edits code, opens a PR. Docker socket API (not CLI) is the right call.
- **Cluster pipelines** — multi-role agent chains (planner → reviewer → coder → tester) with one-click templates.
- **GitHub integration** — PR comments (`/ghostbot fix this`) trigger agent jobs, fine-grained PAT support.
- **Notifications** — Telegram + Slack webhook integrations for job status alerts.
- **Admin panel** — full admin section covering LLMs, Ollama, agents, GitHub, Telegram, Slack, triggers, crons, containers, monitoring, memory, backup, users.
- **VS Code extension** — webview wrapper to embed GhostBot in the editor.

### What Still Needs Work

1. **No public-facing landing page.** This is the biggest gap. Hitting ghostbot.dev dumps you straight into a login form. There's zero context for a new visitor — no feature overview, no screenshots, no "what is this?" Anyone who isn't the admin will bounce immediately. The README is excellent marketing copy that no one outside GitHub will ever see. *(Addressed in Phase 1.1)*
2. **No onboarding flow.** Even after login, a first-time user has to figure out admin setup, LLM configuration, Ollama connection, Docker socket mounting, and GitHub PAT creation all on their own. The /docs route exists but coverage is minimal. *(Addressed in Phase 2.1)*
3. **GitHub repo presentation is bare.** No description, no website link, no topics, no releases, 0 stars, 0 forks. The repo is public but completely undiscoverable. No social preview image. *(Addressed in Phase 1.2)*
4. **VS Code extension isn't published.** "Build the .vsix locally" is a developer-only distribution path. No marketplace listing. *(Addressed in Phase 1.4)*
5. **No demo or screenshots anywhere.** The README is thorough technically but has zero visual proof of the product. No screenshots, no GIFs, no video walkthrough. *(Addressed in Phase 1.2)*
6. **Stack deviation from standard.** GhostBot uses SQLite + Drizzle + NextAuth, whereas the usual stack is Convex + Better Auth. Not necessarily bad (SQLite makes sense for a self-hosted product), but this project lives outside the usual toolchain and won't benefit from shared patterns across other projects.
7. **No monetization path.** No pricing, no SaaS tier, no hosted offering. Purely self-hosted MIT-licensed. Deliberate choice but worth flagging if revenue is ever desired.
8. **Single-server architecture.** SQLite + in-process SSE pub/sub means this doesn't scale horizontally. Fine for personal/small team use, but the ceiling should be documented. *(Addressed in Phase 4.2)*

### Prioritized Recommendations

| Priority | Action | Impact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P1** | Build a public landing page at `/` | Highest — turns a login wall into a product pitch | Phase 1.1 |
| **P2** | Add screenshots/GIFs to the README | High — visual proof converts visitors | Phase 1.2 |
| **P3** | Polish GitHub repo (description, topics, release tag, social preview) | High — discoverability | Phase 1.2 |
| **P4** | Guided setup wizard after first admin login | High — converts signup to active user | Phase 2.1 |
| **P5** | Hosted demo instance at demo.ghostbot.dev | Medium — lets people try before deploying | Phase 4.3 |
| **P6** | One-click deploy buttons (docker-compose, Railway, Coolify) | Medium — lowers self-hosting barrier | Phase 1.3 |
| **P7** | Publish VS Code extension to Marketplace | Medium — opens a new discovery channel | Phase 1.4 |

### Overall Assessment

The product itself is impressively complete for a solo build — 111 commits, 15 DB tables, 4 agent integrations, cluster pipelines, memory/RAG, multi-user, notifications. The engineering is serious. The problem is purely **packaging and presentation**: there's no front door, no visual proof, and no discoverability. The README reads like a product that should have 500+ GitHub stars but nobody can find it yet. Fix the landing page and the repo presentation, and this becomes genuinely competitive in the self-hosted AI agent space alongside tools like Open WebUI and Aider.
